Put 1 or more `.cex` files in this directory with 4 columns of
data for each indeclinable form, as illustrated below.

Note that since these forms are indeclinable, we (exceptionally) include
accents as literal parts of the "stem".

Example:

    StemUrn#LexicalEntity#Stem#InflClass#
    hmt.indecl1#lexent.n51951#kai/#conjunction#
