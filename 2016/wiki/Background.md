Fun fact:  all published algorithms for parsing natural language morphology fail on ancient Greek.  Oops!

The reasons are due to the ways that floating accents interact with morphology.  The Kan≈çnes parsing system takes the approach of using traditional approaches to analyze words with their accent stripped off;  then restoring the appropriate accent for each proposed form, and seeing if the result matches the originally submitted, accented form.
